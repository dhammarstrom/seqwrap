format: gfm
---

seqwrap is an R package that allows you to model high dimensional data using an item-by-item strategy with a specific model engine. Using seqwrap you can fit e.g. gene/transcript data from an RNA-seq experiment to a model specified with random effects or custom distributions. This is possible as seqwrap efficiently iterates over all item (e.g. genes) and fits them to the same model formulation using any implemented model fitting algorithm in R. The package also provides pre- and post-fitting convenience functions. We show how to implement custom models to commonly analysed data and how pre- and post-fitting processing can be used to share information across independent models.
